My Tweets:
I couldn't sleep for a week after that. I killed bunch of more people during those weeks, but that guy was especial.
So the poor guy was still alive. I bet he was in a lot of pain. His voice is still in my head. He sounded like a pig with its throat cut.
One time, I was tired and had a tough conversation with my wife earlier. I dropped the ax on the guy's neck, but I wasn't forceful enough. .
But it's alright. You get used to it. You understand that everything is pointless anyway. Who cares that guy was innocent after all.
But the work is hard. It is damning. It makes you rethink everything. I makes you question the humanity. question the system. the world.
So let me talk about myself then. I am a lonely executioner. I execute people for the government. I am a necessary part of this damn system.
get away from me. please
I just have to tweet something.
Am I too late to the party?
This is new to me. What's happening?
